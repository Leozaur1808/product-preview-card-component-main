## My process

### Built with

- Tailwindcss


### What I learned

Since it is my first tailwindcss experience, I had the ability to test out my knowledge and remind the topics that I had learned in the crash course before starting this. So I can't mention the particular thing or things I've learned here.

Though I would really appreciate if someone could have gave me the way of creating layout of this type without width usage

```html
<div class="sm:w-80">
```


### Continued development

I definitely need more practice of doing 

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ&t=1621s) - Crash Course on tailwindcss, that I watched before doing this challenge(note: this is my first experience with tailwindcss)

## Acknowledgments

I have used google and found some answers on stackoverflow about positioning the box in the centre. I think I could have figured out this by myself, but that gave me a good hint.
